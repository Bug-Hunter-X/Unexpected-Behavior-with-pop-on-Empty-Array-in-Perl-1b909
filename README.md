This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Perl related to using the `pop` function on an empty array. The `bug.pl` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version. The issue occurs because `pop` returns `undef` when called on an empty array, leading to potential issues if not carefully handled.  The solution emphasizes checking for array emptiness before using `pop`.
